# vectors in C++. ðŸ™Œ

## Here are some of the things that we learned:

### Vectors are a sequence of elements that you can access by an index.

### The first index in a vector is 0.
```c++
std::vector<int> even = {2, 4, 6, 8, 10};
```

### Some of the functions that come with vectors:

```c++
.push_back()
.pop_back()
.size()
```

### We can use a for loop to iterate through a vector.
